- 👋 Hi, I’m Ashwanth Ramesh. A graduate student with a burning passion for computational analysis and engineering, especially in the fascinating world of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). ✨
- 📚 I've been so engrossed in studying and working on exciting work projects that I completely forgot to update my GitHub profile. But fear not, for I have returned with a mission to fill this space with my coding adventures! 🚀 Together, let's dive into the realm of numerical simulations and explore the limitless possibilities.
- 💞️ I’m interested in C++ and Python and I’m looking to collaborate on intermediate projects. Together, let's build, learn, and inspire each other!
- 🔬 Science, engineering, and the art of problem-solving are my true passions. As I continue my journey, I am particularly fascinated by the intersection of AI and CFD/CAE. The potential that artificial intelligence holds in revolutionizing these fields is simply mind-boggling! 🤖⚡️
- 🌈 Feel free to explore my repositories and stay tuned for exciting updates. Let's connect and share the joy of coding! 🌟
